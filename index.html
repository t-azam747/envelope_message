                            <p>Thank you for tolerating this careless, clumsy man-child for 3 months. It's been only 3 months with you, and yet, in this short time, you've become such a big part of my life.
                                I just want to say that you're the one I cherish most in my life. Every moment I've shared with you in these few months have been absolute bliss. Thank you for being my peace, my happiness. My Favourite senior. Whether it's a simple conversation or just sitting in silence, everything feels special when I'm with you.
                                Like every relationship, ours have its ups and downs too. But we always find each other at the end of the day. Be ready to hear at least another million of "Sorry" from my side. Cause u ain't getting rid of me easily. I just hope that we can share more beautiful moments together. That I can be the peace, the happiness for you. 
                                Here’s to us — to three beautiful months, and a lifetime more of shared dreams, quiet cuddles, and endless love. I adore you more than words can say. ❤️ I Love You :>
                            </p>
